0010 smartwatch

Until here we used Arduino's IDE development line. This is the moment in time when both IDEs go away from each other. This revision implements the following:

- SmartWatch Toolchain under tools/underchain
- added smartwatch specific IDE version checker
- modified all the names to be in the SmartWatch namespace
- eliminated the AVR toolchain to make the whole thing lighter
- cleaned up all the potential IP infridgements from the IDE: no icons, no splashscreens, no nothing
- kept all the documentation links to the Arduino documentation, in the end this is using the Arduino language
