[the watch, the hack]


This is the story of a watch, a small squared-shaped watch make to make people smile while looking at it and discover a message from a beloved one, a great weather prediction, or the quote of the day. 

The watch was pretty smart, as normal watches cannot do such things, but it had a small issue ... it was closed source. A bunch of hackers, with a mission, decided to give the watch a small present ... it's own freedom. They worked in it day and night and day ... and probably yet another night ... until they got a working toolchain and a hack of Arduino's IDE to allow the watch run applications compiled by -literally- anyone.
