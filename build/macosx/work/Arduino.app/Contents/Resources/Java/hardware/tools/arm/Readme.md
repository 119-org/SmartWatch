Note for you, dear hacker coming his far.

dfu-util has to be compiled with love, using macports or homebrew and my computer was low on HDD so I decided to borrow it from the Maple project by Leaflabs. I took their compiled version, as well as their libusb and put it inside the toolchain. 

This is the economy of open source, we make things as easy as we can to help others do the same.
